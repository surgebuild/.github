Surge is a Bitcoin-native Credit Line that is transparent, decentralized, and trust-minimized. Built from the ground up for self-custody and programmable control, Surge enables Bitcoiners to borrow stablecoins without giving up ownership or compromising on the values that brought them to Bitcoin in the first place.
